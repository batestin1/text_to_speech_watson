>> <h3> Resume </h3>

<p> In this project we use the IBM cloud Watson service called Text To Speech. A powerful API with several features that aims to transform a text, a string into an audio format. In the project example, a folder called "books" is arranged with txt files. These files will be read by the create_audio.py script and their contents will be saved in .wav format in the audios/ folder </p>
